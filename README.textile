h2. Contents

It revolves around a new event-based XML parser, designed to function in nearly the same manner as NSXMLParser, with the same delegation routines. The main difference is that this version uses an NSInputStream as its data source, and it provides data in discrete blocks to the libxml2 parser library.

Beyond the requirement of a stream, it is initialized, setup, and used in the same way as a standard NSXMLParser. Note that, for compile-time type checking, the delegate routines for AQXMLParser are declared again here, with AQXMLParser replacing NSXMLParser. These routines are now also declared inside a protocol using the @optional keyword, to match the new delegation API constructs used in the iPhone SDK.

AQXMLParser is fully gc-compliant, or can be used in a managed-memory environment.
